# DD
A Python-based app to simulate dice rolls for games like Dungeons and Dragons
Future plans include a GUI and possibly character sheets

As of a new direction, the plan is for it to be extensible. It comes bundled with framework for my own custom game system, down the line I can add extensions for standard DnD
